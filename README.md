# Sorting_Visualizer_Pygame
Visualizing Sorting Algorithms

## Objective
This is a Sorting Visualizer built using pygame library in python. Here is a list of columns used for making Sorting Visualizer:

* `window_width` : width of the game vindow
* `window_height` : height of the game window
* `arr` : array for storing the values
* `block_size` : size of each block and corresponds to the speed of the visualizer
* `colour` : colour of the background and colour of each block

## Software and Libraries

This project uses the following software and libraries

* Python 3.8
* pygame
* os
* sys
* random

## About the Visualizer

This is a Sorting Algorithm Visualizer made using pygame. It is user friendly and allow user to generate an array, change the array during run time. It generates new random array each time the button is clicked. It has size of array blocks and speed of the array. Then it has different sorting algorithms to visualize in real time. User can click on the sorting algorithm he/she wish to visualize after he/she sets the speed and size if he/she wish to change. By default the size of each block is set to 40 and speed is also set to 40 frames per second. But a user can chage the settings in run time. Then the visualizer will run and sorts the array. After the sorting is complete, user can again generate new array, set  the size of the blocks and run different algorithms again from starting.

## It supports following algorithms:
  ### `Bubble Sort`
  ### `Selection Sort`
  ### `Merge Sort`
  ### `Quick Sort`
  ### `Heap Sort`
